  <h3>Super Smash Bros. is a series of crossover fighting video games published by Nintendo, and primarily features characters from various Nintendo franchises. The series was created by Masahiro Sakurai, who has directed every game in the series. The original Super Smash Bros. was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64. The series achieved even greater success with the release of Super Smash Bros. Melee, which was released in 2001 for the GameCube and became the bestselling game on that system. A third installment, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, was released in 2008 for the Wii. Although HAL Laboratory had been the developer of the first two games, the third game was developed through the collaboration of several companies. The fourth installment, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, were released in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, respectively. The 3DS installment was the first for a handheld platform. A fifth installment, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, was released in 2018 for the Nintendo Switch.

  <h3 style="color: #343538">An orphaned girl named Riko lives in the Belchero Orphanage in the town of Orth. The town surrounds a strange, giant hole going deep into the Earth, which is commonly called the Abyss. The Abyss harbors artifacts and remnants of a civilization long gone, and is therefore the popular hunting spot for so-called Cave Raiders, who undertake arduous and dangerous descents into the mist-filled pit to recover whatever relics they can find. Returning from the Abyss can be dangerous as "the Curse of the Abyss," a mysterious and potentially fatal malady, manifests upon ascension. The deeper one goes, the more acute the effects of the curse; few who have descended into the lower regions have returned to tell of their experiences. Some legendary Cave Raiders earn the title of White Whistle, one of them being Riko's mother, Lyza. Riko's longing in life is to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a White Whistle. One day she discovers a robot resembling a human boy in the Abyss and names him Reg. Riko and her friends sneak Reg into Belchero and quickly welcome him into their close-knit group. Some time later, a balloon reaches the surface from the depths of the Abyss containing pages of discoveries made by Lyza, as well as a message for Riko stating she is waiting at the bottom of the Abyss. Riko, determined to find her mother, bids farewell to her friends and departs to the Abyss with Reg as her companion. </h3>

  <h3 style="color: #ffffff;">Your Name. (Japanese: Âêõ„ÅÆÂêç„ÅØ„ÄÇ, Hepburn: Kimi no Na wa.) is a 2016 Japanese animated romantic fantasy drama film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, and produced by CoMix Wave Films. The film was produced by Noritaka Kawaguchi and Genki Kawamura, with music composed by Radwimps. Your Name tells the story of Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo and Mitsuha, a high school girl in a rural town, who suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies. The film stars the voices of Ryunosuke Kamiki, Mone Kamishiraishi, Masami Nagasawa and Etsuko Ichihara. Shinkai's eponymous novel was published a month before the film's premiere. Your Name was distributed by Toho. It premiered at the Anime Expo 2016 convention in Los Angeles, California on July 3, 2016, and in Japan on August 26, 2016. It was praised for its animation, complex narrative, musical score, and emotional weight. The film was also a major commercial success, with a total gross of $359 million, becoming the highest-grossing anime film and Japanese film of all time, the fourth highest-grossing film of all time in Japan, the eighth highest-grossing traditionally animated film, and the 14th highest-grossing non-English film worldwide. The film won the Best Animated Feature Film award at 49th Sitges Film Festival, the 2016 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, and the 71st Mainichi Film Awards, as well as receiving a nomination for the 40th Japan Academy Prize for the Best Animation of the Year. The film was followed by Weathering with You in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appeared. An American live-action remake is currently in development. </h3>
